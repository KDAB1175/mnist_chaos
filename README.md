# mnist_chaos
ML classifier on MNIST dataset with sparsely connected layers and connections crossing a layer. Built with Python and Pytorch

# Overview and specs
Idea behind this was to make the model more like a brain, not all nodes are connected and some might go above a layer. This was cardinally stupid idea as it bypasses the needed itterations needed for it to work, also it is like 20k times slower. In the end it is not even how the brain works.
